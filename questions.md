nswer Following Questions in detail.

    What is Machine Learning ?
    ANS: It is the science of making machines work without being explicitly programmed.
    
    What is Data Science ?
    ANS: Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, and         systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.
    
    What is Data Mining ?
    ANS: Data Mining is the science which involves the proper selection of the algorithms for data integration, manipulation and  visualization for business analysis. 
    
    What is Data Analytics ?
    ANS: Data analytics refers to qualitative and quantitative techniques and processes used to enhance productivity and business gain. Data is extracted and categorized to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns, and techniques vary according to organizational requirements.
    
    What are the tools used for the Data Mining ?
    ANS:
    Orange
    Weka
    Python with libraries
    R Programming
    Hadoop
    KNIME
    
    Explain the Limitations of the tools which you have listed in the above questions answer.
    ANS:
    KNIME: Plenty of data integration modules are already included in the core version.
    Python : It requries libraries for data integration, manipulation and  visualization.
    R : Mostly used for statistical modelling.
    Orange : All the functionality are present in python which is light weight language.
    
    What are the tasks in the Machine Learning ?
    ANS: Prediction
    Classification 
    Regression
    EDA analysis
    Pattern Discovery
    etc..
    
    Give at least 5 examples of the tasks which you have given in above question.
    ANS: Amazon Prime (Recommandation) 
         Netflix (Recommandation)
         Flipkart (Recommandation) etc...
    
    Do a research of what is the impact of Machine Learning on the society
    ANS: Machine learning algorithms are evolving in every industry – translating text, identifying faces in photographs, recognising handwriting, piloting drones, driving cars, and so on. And now, machine learning is moving into social, education, and medicine – diverse areas like predicting which participants will drop out of drug-trials and improving selection processes in recruitment.
    
    Research for privacy and machine learning.
    ANS: As machine learning become increasingly powerful, algorithms could conceivably make high confidence predictions without having direct access to your private information. This was already seen to an extent when retailer Target’s predictive algorithm suggested a girl was pregnant and sent her promotional material accordingly - accidentally revealing the secret to her father, but in future it may not even be necessary to have access to any of her personal details to figure it out. In this world, there is no such thing as private information. Given the emphasis that so many put on privacy, the reaction to this is likely to be highly negative.
