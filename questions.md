Answer Following Questions in detail.

    What is Machine Learning ?
        Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output value within an acceptable range.
    
    What is Data Science ?
        Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies. Mining large amounts of structured and unstructured data to identify patterns can help an organization rein in costs, increase efficiencies, recognize new market opportunities and increase the organization's competitive advantage.The data science field employs mathematics, statistics and computer science disciplines, and incorporates techniques like machine learning, cluster analysis, data mining and visualization.
    
    What is Data Mining ?
        Data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and establish relationships to solve problems through data analysis. Data mining tools allow enterprises to predict future trends.
    
    What is Data Analytics ?
        Data analytics (DA) is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions about the information they contain, increasingly with the aid of specialized systems and software. Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries to enable organizations to make more-informed business decisions and by scientists and researchers to verify or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses.
    
    What are the tools used for the Data Mining ?
        1.R-Programming
        2.WEKA
        3.RapidMiner
        4.Orange
        5.NLTK
        6.KNIME
    
    Explain the Limitations of the tools which you have listed in the above questions answer.
        The techniques deployed by some tools are generally well beyond the understanding of the average business analyst or knowledge worker. This is because the tool was generally designed for expert statisticians involved in the detailed science of predictive modeling. This would be the disadvantage of data mining today. If this advanced level of analysis is reserved for the few, instead of for the masses, the full value of data mining in the organization cannot be realized. For those with average analytical capabilities, data mining is not nearly as effective as it could be.
    
    What are the tasks in the Machine Learning ?
    1.Regression
    2.Classification
    3.Clustering
    4.Multivariate querying
    5.Density estimation
    6.Dimension reduction
    7.Testing and matching
    
    Give at least 5 examples of the tasks which you have given in above question.
        1.Kernel regression (Higher accuracy)
        2.Gaussian process regression (Higher accuracy)
        3.Regression trees
        4.Linear regression
        5.Support vector regression
        6.LASSO
        
Do a research of what is the impact of Machine Learning on the society
        a) The moral component — The level of intelligence and “morality” that a machine exerts is a direct result of the data it receives. One consequence is that, based on the data input, machines may train themselves to work against the interest of some humans or be biased. Failure to erase bias from a machine algorithm may produce results that are not in line with the moral standards of society. Yet not all researchers, scientists and experts believe that AI will be hurtful to society. Some believe that AI can be developed to mirror the human brain and obtain human moralistic psychology to enhance society.
        
        b)Accuracy of risk assessments — Risk assessments are used in many areas of society to evaluate and measure the potential risks         that may be involved in specific scenarios. The increasing popularity of using AI risk assessments to make important decisions           on behalf of people is a direct result of the growing trust between humans and machines. However, there are serious implications         to note when using a machine learning system to make risk assessments. A quantitative analyst estimates that some machine               learning strategies may fail up to 90 percent when tested in a real-life setting. The reason is that while algorithms used in           machine learning are based on an almost infinite amount of items, much of this data is very similar. For these machines, finding         a pattern would be easy, but finding  a pattern that will fit every real-life scenario would be difficult.
        
        c)Transparency of algorithms — Supporters of creating transparency in AI advocate for the creation of a shared and regulated            database that is not in possession of any one entity that has the power to manipulate the data; however, there are many reasons          why corporations are not encouraging this. While transparency may be the solution to creating trust between users and machines,          not all users of machine learning see a benefit there.
    
    Research for privacy and machine learning.
         There are several approach to create differentially private machine learning algorithm. These are some approach that has been            used and compiled in this survey.[1]
        
        1) Output Perturbation: Learn the model using clean data, then apply laplacian or exponential mechanism to generate a noisy             model.
        
        2) Objective Perturbation: Add noise to the target function or loss function and use the minimum/maximum of the noisy function           as the output model.

       3) Sample and Aggregate Framework: This method are designed for queries that can be measured with a small number of samples. The           idea is to split the database into many small subset, then aggregating the results while adding noise.
