nswer Following Questions in detail.

    What is Machine Learning ?
    Ans: Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without          being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop            bythemselves.So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This              ispossible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.
    
    What is Data Science ?
    Ans: Data science combine statistics, mathematics, programming, problem-solving, capturing data in ingenious ways, the ability to              look at things differently to find patterns, along with the activities of cleansing, preparing, and aligning the data.
         Dealing with unstructured and structured data, Data Science is a field that encompasses anything related to data cleansing,                preparation, and analysis. Put simply, Data Science is an umbrella term for techniques used when trying to extract insights and            information from data.

    What is Data Mining ?
    Ans:In data mining, association rules are created by analyzing data for frequent if/then patterns, then using the support and                 confidence criteria to locate the most important relationships within the data. Support is how frequently the items appear in the         database, while confidence is the number of times if/then statements are accurate.Other data mining parameters include Sequence or         Path Analysis, Classification, Clustering and Forecasting. Sequence or Path Analysis parameters look for patterns where one event         leads to another later event. A Sequence is an ordered list of sets of items, and it is a common type of data structure found in           many databases. A Classification parameter looks for new patterns, and might result in a change in the way the data is organized.         Classification algorithms predict variables based on other factors within the database.
    
    What is Data Analytics ?
    Ans:Data analytics refers to qualitative and quantitative techniques and processes used to enhance productivity and business gain.             Data is extracted and categorized to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns, and techniques vary according to                   organizational requirements.Data analytics is also known as data analysis.

    Do a research of what is the impact of Machine Learning on the society
    Ans: The Automation era which has been called the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ – is driving new ways of doing business often at            the cost of traditional businesses. When it comes to emerging technologies, numerous companies including Facebook, Google,              Microsoft, and many more are investing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as it is said to be the future. With an increasing                speculation of mass disruption of job roles, in the next 10 – 20 years, will there be anyone left for Learning and Development          to train and develop
    
    Research for privacy and machine learning.
    Ans: The objective of machine learning is to extract useful information from data, while privacy is preserved by concealing                  information. Thus it seems hard to reconcile these competing interests. However, they frequently must be balanced when mining            sensitive data. For example, medical research represents an important application where it is necessary both to extract useful          information and protect patient privacy. One way to resolve the conflict is to extract general characteristics of whole                  populations without disclosing the private information of individuals. In this paper, we consider differential privacy, one of          the most popular and powerful definitions of privacy. We explore the interplay between machine learning and differential                privacy, namely privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms and learning-based data release mechanisms. We also describe              some theoretical results that address what can be learned differentially privately and upper bounds of loss functions for                differentially private algorithms. Finally, we present some open questions, including how to incorporate public data, how to            deal with missing data in private datasets, and whether, as the number of observed samples grows arbitrarily large,                      differentially private machine learning algorithms can be achieved at no cost to utility as compared to corresponding non-              differentially private algorithms.
